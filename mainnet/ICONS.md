To produce icon.icns for mac I used:

https://iconverticons.com/online/

I uploaded icon.png and then downloaded the PNG zip on far right.

Then I unzipped and used tools described here:

https://dentrassi.de/2014/02/25/creating-mac-os-x-icons-icns-on-linux/

...so basically:

png2icns icon.icns *.png

But it barfed on a few resolutions so I just removed them and tried again.
